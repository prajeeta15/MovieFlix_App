name: ðŸš¨ Main WorkFlow

#ditched the idea of creating seperate files for diff workflows it might be scalable and more clan but for apk to run after
#  all the workflows are completed is just to complicated instead we can just put every workflow under one job and use 'need'
#  instead

on:
#  push:
#    branches: [ "master" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "master",  "development"]

  workflow_dispatch:


# ensures one run at a time, and cancel older runs in the queue if new commits r pushed
concurrency:
  group: blank-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
